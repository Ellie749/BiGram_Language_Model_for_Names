    "# Character Level Language Modeling with One Neuron\n",
    "This approach focuses on training a very simple model for character-level language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character-Level Language Modeling:\n",
    "Instead of working with words or phrases, the model operates at the character level.\n",
    "It learns patterns between individual characters in a sequence. For example, it might learn that 'q' is often followed by 'u' in English\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses just a single neuron (a very simple architecture).\n",
    "This minimal setup is designed to demonstrate how even a simple model can capture some sequential patterns in character data.\n",
    "While the capacity of the model is very limited, it can still learn basic relationships between characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to train the model to predict sequences of characters accurately enough to generate meaningful outputs.<br>\n",
    "This approach tries to find the probability distribution of the original characters in the dataset, same as what we did in makemore_probabilistic method. The model tends to make itself as close as possible to the probabilistic model (best closed formulated model).\n",
    "The dataset would typically consist of sequences of characters from a relevant corpus, such as names or text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, the model is used to generate new sequences of characters. In this case, the goal is to generate new human names.\n",
    "By starting with an initial character and using the model to predict one character at a time, a sequence can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method highlights how even extremely simple neural network architectures can capture sequential data patterns to produce coherent outputs within their limitations."
